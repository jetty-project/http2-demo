== HTTP/2 Push Demo

=== Instructions

This demo runs on any OS.

Under Linux, you can execute `simulate-roundtrip.sh` before launching 
the demo to simulate a 250 ms roundtrip delay between client and server.
This is done to try to simulate a real network, otherwise the speed of
the loopback interface (localhost) makes _any_ protocol appear fast. 

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install
$ ./simulate-roundtrip.sh
$ mvn jetty:run
